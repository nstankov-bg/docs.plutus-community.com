# Intro

Hey! The documentation for Plutus is pretty lacking so far, so we decided to make our own, as a community :)

Please feel free to commit any .MD files linked to setup or your studies. We'll figure out where to put them, so that they are not scattered around Discord.

The website is hosted on a single node, that runs in a utility-room, somewhere. Have mercy over its soul.
The page lives [here](http://docs.plutus-community.com)

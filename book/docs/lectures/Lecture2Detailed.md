# Lecture #2 - Detailed Overview - Week02 Plutus Pioneer Program

## Credits

Condensed version of Lecture #2 of the Plutus Pioneer Program by Lars BrÃ¼njes on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/E5KRk5y9KjQ)
Cloned from [Reddit (u/RikAlexander)](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/mumpdx/week_02_plutus_pioneer_program/)

## Setup

1 - First get the Local Playground up and running

Check the sidebar for instructions on how to do this.

2 - Second you need the Git Repository of the Plutus Pioneer Program

Also check the sidebar for instructions if needed.

3 - We'll start with the first example of the week02 Video.

    plutus-pioneer-program/code/week01/src/Week02/Gift.hs

open this file in your favorite editor (VS code of course)

4 - copy all contents, and plug it into the playground

this should compile, and we can go into the simulation (the nice blue button with "simulate" written in it)

## Gift

1 - The Script is called "Gift" for a reason. Wallet01 will be gifting the script some amount of Lovelaces. Wallet02 will try to "grab" the funds locked in this script.

Try it. Make Wallet01 give 3 lovelaces, and make Wallet02 grab them.

![Gift Actions](https://preview.redd.it/as1zvr8ctau61.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa7f4f965cb96fa88de3c75f27a10b9bb603eff6)

2 - As you can see the funds have changed to Wallet01 -> 7 Lovelaces, Wallet02 -> 13 Lovelaces

![Gift Final Balances](https://preview.redd.it/jvv5jebetau61.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=261125bd456105f145b45c9460124ebabc80d850)

Now at this point, of course anyone could grab the funds. Which (normally) you wouldn't want. This is where the Validator comes in to play.

## mkValidator

1 - The main topic of the Lecture was the so called "Validator"

Lines 30 - 32 in the Gift.hs file

    {-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}
    mkValidator :: Data -> Data -> Data -> ()
    mkValidator _ _ _ = ()

This is the Haskell syntax for essentially a "function".

mkValidator (or Make Validator), is the name of the function

Which has 3 parameters and 1 return type.

    mkValidator :: Data -> Data -> Data -> ()

The return type: () is called a "Unit". But you can more or less think of this as "void".

If we were to write this in "normal" code; it would look something like:

    public void mkValidator(Data x, Data y, Data z) {}

2 - Now for the implementation

    mkValidator _ _ _ = ()

The Three underscores are for Data 1-3. It basically means that we don't care what will happen to them. As we will always just return "Unit".

We could also write it as:

    mkValidator x y z = ()

But \_ is usually used for parameters we don't care about.

3 - The Inlinable Pragma

    {-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}

This is there to let the compiler know that the function mkValidator may be used as an inline function. (We'll get back to this in a second)

4 - The "Data" datatype. What is it?

Well it can be all sorts of things. It can be a Map, a List, a simple Integer (I) or a string. It all depends on how you "construct" it. It's "real" name is: PlutusTx.Data in the [Data.hs](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-tx/src/PlutusTx/Data.hs) file in the Plutus Repo where we can read more about the Data type.

5 - The 3 Parameters. (x, y, z) They are the Datum, Redeemer and Context.

Datum - arbitrary data; can be used to provide more information to the Validator script (which in turn e.g. could also be used to be validated against the Redeemer)

Redeemer - arbitrary data; used to validate if the user calling the script may unlock the funds or not. (e.g. a password for unlocking)

Context - This holds information about the Transaction

## Validator Script

Lines 34 - 35 of Gift.hs

    validator :: Validator
    validator = mkValidatorScript $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| mkValidator ||])

To get our mkValidator to work on the blockchain, it needs to be compiled to Plutus core.

1 - To do this, we'll use something called `Oxford Brackets`.

In short the PlutusTx.compile function needs an inline function; but this can be hard (if not impossible) to write for bigger functions. This is why we need the Inlinable Pragma `{-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}` It tells the compiler that mkValidator may be used as an inline function. The `[|| mkValidator ||]` "inlines" the function, and hands it over to PlutusTx.compile.

PlutusTx.compile returns the Plutus Core compiled script, so that `mkValidatorScript` can read it, and make the validator blockchain-ready.

## Script Address

We need to generate our Script Address.

1 - To do that we'll generate a Hash based on the `validator` script that we just created.

Lines 37 - 38 of Gift.hs

    valHash :: Ledger.ValidatorHash
    valHash = Scripts.validatorHash validator

This is pretty self-explanatory; `valHash` is of type `Ledger.ValidatorHash`

`Scripts.validatorHash` will hash our validator to a `Ledger.ValidatorHash` type Hash

2 - Now that we have the Hash we can generate our Address!

Lines 40 - 41 of Gift.hs

    scrAddress :: Ledger.Address
    scrAddress = ScriptAddress valHash

Same here: `scrAddress` is of type Ledger.Address `ScriptAddress` will generate our address based on the `valHash` variable.

## The Wallet code

From line 43 in Gift.hs

This was not covered in the Lecture; we'll probably go more in depth in Week03.

1 - The first few lines though are easy to understand:

Line 43 - 46 in Gift.hs

    type GiftSchema =
    BlockchainActions
        .\/ Endpoint "give" Integer
        .\/ Endpoint "grab" ()

This defines our endpoints (which you can both see in the playground)

The `give` endpoint receives an Integer.

And the `grab` endpoint does not receive anything: Type Unit (Void)

## Error Handling

Open the file

    plutus-pioneer-program/code/week01/src/Week02/Burn.hs

This script is almost identical to Gift.hs, but now the Validator looks like this

Lines 31 - 33 in Burn.hs

    {-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}
    mkValidator :: Data -> Data -> Data -> ()
    mkValidator _ _ _ = traceError "NO WAY!"

As you can see the validator always returns the error "NO WAY!".

The reason this file is called "Burn" is because you can still send funds into the script with the `Give` endpoints, although you will never be able to `Grab` them.

Essentially this will `Burn` the funds send to this script, as it will receive but never release them.

*Note:* Try it in the Playground to help you get used to the playground workflow

## FortyTwo

Burning funds is (probably) not what we want to do. In this example by Lars we will implement a simple Validator based on user input (the Redeemer)

Open the file

    plutus-pioneer-program/code/week01/src/Week02/FortyTwo.hs

And go and check out our new Validator

Lines 31 - 35 in FortyTwo.hs

    {-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}
    mkValidator :: Data -> Data -> Data -> ()
    mkValidator _ r _
        | r == I 42 = ()
        | otherwise = traceError "wrong redeemer"

This time we'll validate the Redeemer and check if it equals `42` (hence the name of the script).

As you may recall we have the 3 Data type arguments, which equal to:

Datum, Redeemer and Context

Specifically the Redeemer argument is now set to the variable `r`

    mkValidator _ r _

By using [Guards](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/functional-programming-haskell/0/steps/27226) (a Haskell kind of if-else statement)

We'll check if the Redeemer `r` is equal to 42, otherwise we throw the error "wrong redeemer"

Note: as you can see we use `I 42` and not just 42. This is because I is a constructor for a [Data](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus/blob/master/plutus-tx/src/PlutusTx/Data.hs) type.

## Typed

Open the file

    plutus-pioneer-program/code/week01/src/Week02/Typed.hs

Again check our Validator

Lines 32 - 36 in Typed.hs

    {-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}
    mkValidator :: () -> Integer -> ValidatorCtx -> Bool
    mkValidator () r _
        | r == 42   = True
        | otherwise = False

The big difference here is, instead of specifying the 3 arguments as Data.

We implicitly specify which type we want/expect to receive. In this case:

Datum -> () = Unit = (Void)

Redeemer -> Integer

Context -> ValidatorCtx

Also the Validator is now returning a Bool. (True -> Success! False -> :( )

*Note:* as you can see we don't run our magic number 42 through the `I` constructor anymore `r == 42`, because now `r` is already just an Integer; no need to compare it to another Data type.

Now the lines 38 - 48 in Typed.hs are more or less copy-paste.

    data Typed
    instance Scripts.ScriptType Typed where
        type instance DatumType Typed = ()
        type instance RedeemerType Typed = Integer

    inst :: Scripts.ScriptInstance Typed
    inst = Scripts.validator @Typed
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| mkValidator ||])
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| wrap ||])
    where
        wrap = Scripts.wrapValidator @() @Integer

The most important thing here are the lines

    type instance DatumType Typed = ()
    type instance RedeemerType Typed = Integer

These lines will set the Datum to Type () = Unit = (Void) and the Redeemer to Type Integer.

Now we have a new instance of a validator only with strict types.

## Custom data types

Open the file:

    plutus-pioneer-program/code/week01/src/Week02/IsData.hs

Let's have a look at our Validator first:

Lines 37 - 39 of IsData.hs

    {-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}
    mkValidator :: () -> MySillyRedeemer -> ValidatorCtx -> Bool
    mkValidator () (MySillyRedeemer r) _ = traceIfFalse "wrong redeemer" $ r == 42

We now have a new type for our Redeemer: MySillyRedeemer!

Instead of Guards, we now have the traceIfFalse function. The dollar sign basically says: everything behind me should first be evaluated, then passed on to the traceIfFalse function.

So r == 42 is evaluated to either True or False, is then passed on to the traceIfFalse function, which when False will throw the error "wrong redeemer".

Specified on lines 32 - 33 of `IsData.hs` is our new Type

    newtype MySillyRedeemer = MySillyRedeemer Integer
        deriving Show

What we're doing here is creating a new type (`newtype`) with the name `MySillyRedeemer` which acts and does the same as `Integer` (get the Silly part of the name now? :D )

`deriving Show` is Haskell syntax, and means that `MySillyRedeemer` now also inherits the Show functionality, which basically means we can now `Show` or `print` MySillyRedeemer.

Line 35 of IsData.hs

    PlutusTx.unstableMakeIsData ''MySillyRedeemer

Basically says: make MySillyRedeemer of type Data. (which we need for using it as Redeemer)

Now the validator will be happy to receive our MySillyRedeemer as Redeemer argument.

Lines 41 - 51 of IsData.hs

    data Typed
    instance Scripts.ScriptType Typed where
        type instance DatumType Typed = ()
        type instance RedeemerType Typed = MySillyRedeemer

    inst :: Scripts.ScriptInstance Typed
    inst = Scripts.validator @Typed
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| mkValidator ||])
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| wrap ||])
    where
        wrap = Scripts.wrapValidator @() @MySillyRedeemer

Compare them with Typed.hs; Integer is now changed to MySillyRedeemer.

## Homework 1

Open the file:

    plutus-pioneer-program/code/week01/src/Week02/Homework1.hs

1 - Copy everything into the Playground

Our homework is it to fix the lines 32 - 51

    {-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}
    -- This should validate if and only if the two Booleans in the redeemer are equal!
    mkValidator :: () -> (Bool, Bool) -> ValidatorCtx -> Bool
    mkValidator _ _ _ = True -- FIX ME!

    data Typed
    instance Scripts.ScriptType Typed where
    -- Implement the instance!

    inst :: Scripts.ScriptInstance Typed
    inst = undefined -- FIX ME!

    validator :: Validator
    validator = undefined -- FIX ME!

    valHash :: Ledger.ValidatorHash
    valHash = undefined -- FIX ME!

    scrAddress :: Ledger.Address
    scrAddress = undefined -- FIX ME!

We'll start with the first "fix me". The validator.

The validator will now receive a Redeemer of (Bool, Bool) which is a [Tuple](http://www.cantab.net/users/antoni.diller/haskell/units/unit07.html).

Easy way to look at it: it's an array of 2 Booleans.

2 - To fix the first "fix me" we'll need to check if these two Booleans are Equal.

To extract both Booleans we can just assign them to 2 variables, compare them, and return either True or False.

    mkValidator () (a, b) _ = a == b

This will work fine, but what we learned in IsData.hs is the traceIfFalse function. We can implement it, for a cleaner code with some error reporting:

    mkValidator () (a, b) _ = traceIfFalse "wrong redeemer" $ a == b

This was the hard part of Homework1.

3 - Now it's copy and paste from either IsData.hs or Typed.hs, only with the `(Bool, Bool)` tuple type, instead of mySillyRedeemer or Integer.

    data Typed
    instance Scripts.ScriptType Typed where
        type instance DatumType Typed = ()
        type instance RedeemerType Typed = (Bool, Bool)

    inst :: Scripts.ScriptInstance Typed
    inst = Scripts.validator @Typed
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| mkValidator ||])
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| wrap ||])
        where
            wrap = Scripts.wrapValidator @() @(Bool, Bool)

    validator :: Validator
    validator = Scripts.validatorScript inst

    valHash :: Ledger.ValidatorHash
    valHash = Scripts.validatorHash validator

    scrAddress :: Ledger.Address
    scrAddress = ScriptAddress valHash

    type GiftSchema =
        BlockchainActions
            .\/ Endpoint "give" Integer
            .\/ Endpoint "grab" (Bool, Bool)

We can now compile and simulate our script.

Set up the actions like so:

![Homework 1 Actions](https://preview.redd.it/7tdo1n99tau61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=19bc99a790439d2cf9b2703fd2fc9bab4a0d234a)

And play with the `Grab` action; if both booleans are equal, the grab will succeed, otherwise it will fail.

## Homework 2

If you made it all the way down here, Homework 2 is a walk in the park.

1 - Copy everything from the file into the playground:

    plutus-pioneer-program/code/week01/src/Week02/Homework2.hs

First check the validator

Lines 43 - 46 in Homework2.hs

    {-# INLINABLE mkValidator #-}
    -- This should validate if and only if the two Booleans in the redeemer are equal!
    mkValidator :: () -> MyRedeemer -> ValidatorCtx -> Bool
    mkValidator _ _ _ = True -- FIX ME!

Which is basically the same as for homework 1, only difference is that now we are passing a custom type as Redeemer `MyRedeemer`.

This is defined on lines 36 - 39 in Homework2.hs

    data MyRedeemer = MyRedeemer
        { flag1 :: Bool
        , flag2 :: Bool
        } deriving (Generic, FromJSON, ToJSON, ToSchema)

2 - Basically all we need to do is change our validator to compare both Booleans in the MyRedeemer type

    mkValidator :: () -> MyRedeemer -> ValidatorCtx -> Bool
    mkValidator () (MyRedeemer a b) _ = a == b

and same as for Homework1 we'll use the traceIfFalse function here

    mkValidator () (MyRedeemer a b) _ = traceIfFalse "wrong redeemer" $ a == b

That's it.

3 - For the last few "fix me", it's copy and paste time again from either IsData.hs or Typed.hs or even Homework1.hs. Only now with the MyRedeemer type instead of Integer, (Bool, Bool) or mySillyRedeemer

    data Typed
    instance Scripts.ScriptType Typed where
        type instance DatumType Typed = ()
        type instance RedeemerType Typed = MyRedeemer

    inst :: Scripts.ScriptInstance Typed
    inst = Scripts.validator @Typed
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| mkValidator ||])
        $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| wrap ||])
        where
            wrap = Scripts.wrapValidator @() @MyRedeemer

    validator :: Validator
    validator = Scripts.validatorScript inst

    valHash :: Ledger.ValidatorHash
    valHash = Scripts.validatorHash validator

    scrAddress :: Ledger.Address
    scrAddress = ScriptAddress valHash

    type GiftSchema =
        BlockchainActions
            .\/ Endpoint "give" Integer
            .\/ Endpoint "grab" MyRedeemer

We're all set!

![Homework 2 Actions](https://preview.redd.it/n1iip6n6tau61.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff22b62b022df9c396b97387ff1a97186d3fac45)

Admire your work in the Playground. Play with it. Test it. Happy Coding! ð
